# loopback-object-acl
Loopback provides great "class-level" ACL's for restricting access to a whole Model or its mehods, but greatly lacks the ability to restric access to individual objects. This project tries to solve this, by setting object-level ACL's on each object, and manipulates Loopback's Query to only return objects the requesting user has access to.

## Examples

### User Read-level permissions
Lets say we want a Book-object only to be readable (pun intended) by 3 users (id: "aaa", id: "bbb" and id: "ccc"):

POST /api/books
```js
{
   "title": "Clean Code",
   "subtitle": "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
   "$acl":{
     "r_perm": {
       "users":["aaa", "bbb", "ccc"]
     }
   }
}
```

The mixin will parse the object to be stored as in Mongo:

```js
{
   id: ObjectId("123"),
   title: "Clean Code",
   subtitle: "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
   r: {
     u: ["aaa", "bbb", "ccc"]
     g: []
   },
   w: {
     u: [],
     g: []
   }
}
```
This object can now only be accessed by a user with an id of "aaa", "bbb" or "ccc" and no one else. When retrieving, the mixin will parse the object's ACL right back again:

GET /api/books/123
```js
{
   "id": "123"
   "title": "Clean Code",
   "subtitle": "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
   "$acl":{
     "r_perm": {
       "users":["aaa", "bbb", "ccc"]
     }
   }
}
```

### Group Read-level permissions
To specifiy every user that will have access to the object can be cumbersome and timeconsuming. This is where groups come in handy.

POST /api/books
```js
{
   "title": "Clean Code",
   "subtitle": "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
   "$acl":{
     "r_perm": {
       "groups":["group-id-1"]
     }
   }
}
```

As you've might guessed, this object is now accessible by users who has `group-id-1` specified in `acl_groups` on the User object.

### Combining Group and Read-level permissions
If `user-id-1` and `user-id-2` is not in `group-id-1` then these users can have explicit access this way:

POST /api/books
```js
{
   "title": "Clean Code",
   "subtitle": "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
   "$acl":{
     "r_perm": {
       "groups":["group-id-1"],
       "users":["user-id-1", "user-id-2"]
     }
   }
}
```

### Public objects
If you have installed the mixin on your model but you dont specify `$acl` on creation of a new object, the objects visibility will be public, ex: 

POST /api/books
```js
{
   "title": "Clean Code",
   "subtitle": "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"
}
```

returns

```js
{
   "title": "Clean Code",
   "subtitle": "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
   "$acl":{
     "r_perm": {
       "groups":["*"],
       "users":["*"]
     },
     "w_perm": {
       "groups":["*"],
       "users":["*"]
     }
   }
}
```


## Install

```
npm install --save loopback-object-acl
```

In `model-config.json` add `../node_modules/loopback-object-acl` to mixins

```js
  "_meta": {
    "sources": [
      "loopback/common/models",
      "loopback/server/models",
      "../common/models",
      "./models"
    ],
    "mixins": [
      "loopback/common/mixins",
      "loopback/server/mixins",
      "../common/mixins",
      "./mixins",
      "../node_modules/loopback-object-acl"
    ]
 Â }
```

Set `ObjectAclController` on what ever model you would like to protect with Object-level ACL:

```js
book.json

{
  "name": "Book",
  "base": "PersistedModel",
  "idInjection": true,
  "options": {
    "validateUpsert": true
  },
  "mixins": {
    "ObjectAclController": {}
  }
  ...
}
```
### CurrentUser in context
This mixins expects a `currentUser` object on the `options` object. This is **not** default Loopback v3.x behavior, and must be implemented before usage.

Implementation can found here: http://loopback.io//doc/en/lb3/Using-current-context.html#use-a-custom-strong-remoting-phase

## Compatibility
This mixin is only tested with **Loopback v3.X** and using **MongoDB** as DataSource

## TODO

### Read-permissions
- [x] Do only return objects from database that the requesting user has access to.

### Write-permissions
Version 2.0

### Client
- [x] Set ACL on object-creation
- [ ] Set permissions on user creation


### Tests
- [x] ObjectAcl.js
- [x] CurrentUserUtil.js
